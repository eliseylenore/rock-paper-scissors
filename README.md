The program will take two inputs (one from each player) and return a winner result. Example(Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins, Rock v. Paper = Paper wins, Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins)
Input: p1= Rock, p2= Scissor
Output: Player One Wins

If both players choose the same input, the result is a draw.
Input: p1 = Rock, p2 = Rock
Output: Draw!
